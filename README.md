## Action Based on Transactions
Identify wallets and track each transaction
Buy the Hero token before the user does
Sell the Hero token immediately after the user buys it
## Profit Strategy
Sell the Hero token immediately after the user buys it to make a profit

## New Holder Monitoring
Continuously watch for new holders of the Hero token
Repeat the process: find new wallets trading only in the Hero token, track transactions, buy before they buy, and sell after they sell
