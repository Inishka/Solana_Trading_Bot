##Trading Bot for Hero Token using Node.js
#Overview
This repository contains a Node.js implementation of a trading bot that focuses on identifying and tracking specific types of holders for the Hero token. The bot monitors transactions, buys the token before the user does, and sells immediately after the user buys it, using custom parameters for timeouts.
